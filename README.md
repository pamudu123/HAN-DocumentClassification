# HAN Document Classification (2016) - Presentation

A comprehensive presentation on **Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification**, showcasing the architecture, methodology, and applications of this influential deep learning approach for text classification tasks.

## üéØ Overview

This presentation explores the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture introduced for document classification tasks. HAN represents a significant advancement in natural language processing by incorporating hierarchical structure and attention mechanisms to better understand document-level semantics.

### What is HAN?

Hierarchical Attention Networks employ a two-level attention mechanism:
- **Word-level attention**: Focuses on important words within sentences
- **Sentence-level attention**: Identifies key sentences within documents

This hierarchical approach mirrors human reading comprehension and significantly improves classification performance on long documents.
